- `useDTMF`: DTMF tone sending with queue management
- `usePresence`: SIP presence (SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY) support
- `useMessaging`: SIP MESSAGE support for instant messaging
- `useConference`: Multi-party conference calling with participant management

#### State Management (Phase 5)
- `callStore`: Centralized call state management
- `deviceStore`: Media device state management
- `connectionStore`: SIP connection state management
- `presenceStore`: Presence state management
- Persistence system with localStorage and IndexedDB adapters
- Automatic state restoration on reload

#### Provider Components (Phase 6)
- `SipClientProvider`: Root-level SIP client management
- `ConfigProvider`: Configuration management with validation
- `MediaProvider`: Media device and permission management

#### Plugin System (Phase 7)
- `PluginManager`: Plugin lifecycle and registration
- `HookManager`: Hook system with priorities
- `AnalyticsPlugin`: Call analytics and event tracking
- `RecordingPlugin`: Call recording with MediaRecorder API and IndexedDB storage

#### Testing Infrastructure (Phases 8-10)
- 19 comprehensive unit test suites covering all utilities, core classes, composables, stores, plugins, and providers
- 584+ total unit tests with >80% code coverage
- 4 integration test suites with MockSipServer helper
- 45+ E2E tests with Playwright (cross-browser support)
- Parallel test execution configuration
- CI/CD-ready test infrastructure

#### Documentation (Phase 11.1-11.8)
- **Phase 11.1**: JSDoc/TSDoc documentation for `useConference` composable
- **Phase 11.4**: Complete plugin system documentation (PluginManager, HookManager, AnalyticsPlugin, RecordingPlugin)
- **Phase 11.5**: 11 comprehensive user guides covering:
  - Getting Started

  - Device Management
  - Call History
  - Presence and Messaging
  - Video Calling (with multi-party conferencing section)
  - Error Handling
  - Security Best Practices
  - Performance Optimization
- **Phase 11.6**: 5 production-ready example applications:
  - Basic Audio Call (~1,000 lines, 2 components)
  - Video Call (~2,500 lines, 4 components)
  - Multi-Line Phone (~2,200 lines, 4 components, supports 5 concurrent calls)
  - Conference Call (~1,331 lines, 5 components)
  - Call Center (~2,000 lines, 7 components, enterprise-grade)

- **Presence**: SIP PUBLISH/SUBSCRIBE for user presence
- **Messaging**: SIP MESSAGE for instant messaging
- **Network Resilience**: Automatic reconnection, connection state management
- **Quality Management**: Automatic quality adjustment based on network conditions

### Changed
- **Breaking**: Renamed composables for consistency:
  - `useSipConnection` → `useSipClient`
  - `useSipCall` → `useCallSession`
  - `useSipDtmf` → `useDTMF`
  - `useAudioDevices` → `useMediaDevices`
- **Breaking**: Updated `useSipClient` API:
  - Must call `updateConfig()` before `connect()` (previously config was passed to `connect()`)
  - Added validation with `ValidationResult` return type
- **Breaking**: `useCallSession` now requires `sipClientRef` parameter
- **Breaking**: `useMediaDevices` method names:
  - `setAudioInput/Output` → `selectAudioInput/Output`
  - `selectedAudioInput` → `selectedAudioInputId`
- Improved TypeScript type safety across all modules (eliminated all 'any' types)
- Enhanced error handling with comprehensive try-catch blocks and user-friendly messages
- Improved call state transitions with proper event emission

### Fixed
- **Critical**: CallSession data exposure bug (toInterface() returned direct reference)
- **Critical**: CallSession duration calculation (added validation for negative durations)
- **Critical**: Media track duplication causing memory leaks
- **Critical**: Missing reject() method for incoming calls
- **Critical**: DTMF queue implementation (proper sequential sending with timing)
- **Critical**: 11 critical bugs in example applications (Phase 11.6 review)
- Fixed 200+ TypeScript errors through systematic improvements
- Fixed EventBus type alignment issues
- Fixed readonly config compatibility issues
- Fixed MediaDeviceKind type compatibility
- Fixed SipClient conference method stubs
- Fixed integration test timing and validation issues
- Fixed E2E test infrastructure for CI/CD compatibility

### Security
- Digest authentication (MD5) with 401/407 challenge handling
- Authorization username override support
- HA1 hash support for enhanced security
- Transport security (WSS/TLS) support
- Media encryption (DTLS-SRTP) via WebRTC
- Input validation for SIP URIs and phone numbers
- Credential storage best practices documentation
