# Performance Tests - Fixes and Improvements

## Problem Summary

The previous PR (#59) added comprehensive performance testing infrastructure but was reverted due to missing GitHub Actions configuration. The tests couldn't run in CI because:

1. **No GitHub Actions workflow file** - Tests were added but no `.github/workflows/test.yml` existed
2. **CI configuration missing** - No automated way to run the performance tests
3. **No documentation** - Unclear how to run tests in CI vs locally

## What Was Fixed

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/test.yml`)

Created a comprehensive CI workflow with three jobs:

#### Job 1: Standard Tests
- Runs on Node 18.x and 20.x (matrix strategy)
- Executes linting, type checking, unit tests, and integration tests
- Generates and uploads coverage reports
- Uses pnpm for package management (matching project setup)

#### Job 2: Performance Tests
- Dedicated job for performance testing on Node 20.x
- Runs benchmarks, load tests, and metrics collection
- Uses `--expose-gc` flag for accurate memory measurements
- Marked as `continue-on-error: true` to prevent blocking PRs on performance regressions
- Uploads performance results as artifacts

#### Job 3: Build
- Validates that the package builds successfully
- Checks bundle size against performance budgets
- Uploads build artifacts

### 2. Test Script Configuration

The `package.json` already had proper scripts from the previous PR:

```json
{
  "test:performance": "vitest run tests/performance",
  "test:performance:bench": "vitest bench tests/performance/benchmarks",
  "test:performance:load": "vitest run tests/performance/load-tests",
  "test:performance:metrics": "vitest run tests/performance/metrics",
  "test:performance:gc": "node --expose-gc ./node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs tests/performance"
}
```

### 3. Workflow Features

- **Parallel execution**: Tests run concurrently for faster CI
- **Matrix strategy**: Tests on multiple Node versions
- **Artifact uploads**: Performance results and coverage reports saved
- **Smart error handling**: Performance tests won't block PRs but will report issues
- **Branch triggers**: Runs on `main`, `develop`, and `claude/**` branches

## How to Run Tests

### Locally

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run only unit tests
pnpm run test:unit

# Run only performance tests
pnpm run test:performance

# Run performance tests with GC (recommended)
pnpm run test:performance:gc

# Run specific performance test suites
pnpm run test:performance:bench    # Benchmarks
pnpm run test:performance:load     # Load tests
pnpm run test:performance:metrics  # Metrics collection
```

### In CI

Tests automatically run when:
- Pushing to `main`, `develop`, or `claude/**` branches
- Opening a pull request to `main` or `develop`

### Viewing Results

1. **In GitHub Actions UI**: Click on the workflow run to see all test results
2. **Artifacts**: Download performance results and coverage reports from the artifacts section
3. **Logs**: View detailed logs for each test job

## Key Improvements Over Previous PR

1. **CI Integration**: Now runs automatically in GitHub Actions
2. **Error Handling**: Performance tests won't block PRs but will report issues
3. **Multiple Node Versions**: Tests run on both Node 18 and 20
4. **Artifacts**: Results saved for analysis
5. **Clear Documentation**: This file explains the setup and fixes
6. **Branch Strategy**: Properly configured for the project's git workflow

## Performance Budgets

The tests validate against these budgets (defined in `src/utils/constants.ts`):

| Metric | Budget | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Bundle Size | 150 KB | Keep library lightweight |
| Bundle Size (Gzipped) | 50 KB | Network transfer size |
| Call Setup Time | 2000 ms | User experience |
| State Update Latency | 50 ms | Reactivity |
| Event Propagation | 10 ms | Real-time updates |
| Memory Per Call | 50 MB | Resource usage |
| Max Concurrent Calls | 5 | System stability |

## Testing Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Run performance tests locally** before pushing
2. **Check for regressions** - ensure your changes don't degrade performance
3. **Use `--expose-gc`** for memory tests to get accurate measurements
4. **Review CI results** - check performance artifacts after CI runs

### For Reviewers

1. **Check performance artifacts** - download and review performance results
2. **Compare with baseline** - ensure no significant regressions
3. **Review warnings** - performance warnings indicate approaching budget limits
4. **Validate changes** - ensure performance-critical code has appropriate tests

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Memory measurements show 0

**Solution**: Run tests with `--expose-gc` flag:
```bash
pnpm run test:performance:gc
```

### Issue: Performance tests are flaky

**Causes**:
- System load
- Insufficient warmup iterations
- Non-deterministic behavior

**Solutions**:
- Run tests multiple times
- Increase iteration count
- Use percentiles (P95, P99) instead of max values
- Close other applications

### Issue: Tests fail in CI but pass locally

**Causes**:
- Different Node versions
- Different system resources
- Network timing

**Solutions**:
- Run tests with the same Node version as CI
- Check GitHub Actions logs for specific errors
- Adjust timeouts for CI environment (TIMEOUT_MULTIPLIER)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Performance Dashboards**: Track metrics over time
2. **Regression Detection**: Automated comparison with baseline
3. **Performance Budgets in CI**: Fail CI if critical budgets exceeded
4. **Visual Reports**: Generate charts and graphs from performance data
5. **Browser Testing**: Add real browser performance tests with Playwright
